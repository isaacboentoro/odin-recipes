    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This beef pho features a comforting, richly-seasoned meat broth ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced
        sirloin. Serve with hoisin, Sriracha, green onion, cilantro, bean sprouts, basil, and lime.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Beef bones and tough beef cuts</li>
        <li>Flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>Aromatics</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Daikon</li>
        <li>Salt, sugar, and fish sauce</li>
        <li>Steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>In Lett101's recipe, the beef pho broth is simmered in two phases. Charring onion and ginger slightly turns their
        harshness into sweetness, which is then extracted in the simmering process. After straining and chilling, the
        fat congeals and is removed. Then the broth is reheated, bowls are assembled with noodles and thinly sliced
        steak, and the broth is ladled into the bowls to heat things through and cook off the raw beef. </p>
